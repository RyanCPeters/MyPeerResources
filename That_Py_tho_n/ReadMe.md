# P-P-P-Python Breaker...

Is what I generally feel like I am when I try to trouble shoot misbehaving .py files.

This subfolder is for Python code written by my friends and peers that is generally not behaving as expected or is somehow failing to solve some specific problem.

Python isn't my primary language, but I'm finding that analyzing other peoples py-code or trying to help debug that code to be a most educational process.
