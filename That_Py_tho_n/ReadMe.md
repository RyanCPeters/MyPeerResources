# P-P-P-Python Breaker...

Is what I generally feel like I am when I try to trouble shoot misbehaving .py files.

This subfolder is for Python code written by my friends and peers that is generally not behaving as expected or is somehow failing to solve some specific problem.

I am no expert at python, yet, and I'm finding that analyzing other peoples code or trying to help debug their code to be a most educational process.
